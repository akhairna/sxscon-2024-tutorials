    "This series of notebooks describes the `sxs` python package, which provides an interface to the data produced by the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes collaboration.  All that data is hosted on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/sxs) and [CaltechDATA](https://data.caltech.edu/).  Each simulation gets its own DOI and its own web page — like [this one](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1213436), for example.  But you want an easier way to get the data than clicking on links.  This package will do that for you.\n",

    "The documentation is [here](https://sxs.readthedocs.io/en/main/).  The github page is [here](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/sxs/).  Please feel free to open issues to report problems, or pull requests to fix them."

    "This installs nice goodies like [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) for running interactive notebooks like this one yourself.  On non-Windows systems, this also installs some other useful packages from the SXS collaboration, like [`scri`](https://github.com/moble/scri)."
