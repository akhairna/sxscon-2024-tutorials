    "We begin by simply loading the simulation.  There are three pieces of\n",
    "information needed to identify a simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. SXS ID\n",
    "\n",
    "     This identifies the simulation type and includes a number.  For\n",
    "     example, \"SXS:BBH:0123\", which identifies this simulation as a\n",
    "     product of the SXS collaboration, specifies that it is a binary\n",
    "     black hole simulation, and that it has been assigned the number\n",
    "     \"0123\" in that series.  Note that these numbers are not\n",
    "     necessarily sequential.  Nor do they necessarily correspond to\n",
    "     the relative age of the simulation; that information is contained\n",
    "     in the metadata itself in the various `date_*` keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Version\n",
    "     \n",
    "     This identifies the version of the data — like \"v2.0\".  Unlike\n",
    "     the SXS ID, this is an optional specifier.  If not provided, the\n",
    "     most recent version is used.  All versions refer to the same\n",
    "     underlying simulation, but the raw data may have been processed\n",
    "     differently, may be provided in incompatible formats, etc.  For\n",
    "     exploratory work, it is often convenient to simply use the most\n",
    "     recent version.  However, for reproducibility, it is important to\n",
    "     specify the version of the data you use for a given analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Lev (resolution)\n",
    "      \n",
    "      This identifies the resolution of the simulation — like \"Lev5\".\n",
    "      This is also optional.  If not provided, the highest resolution\n",
    "      is used.  Note that there is no consistency in the \"Lev\"s\n",
    "      provided for different simulations, nor is there necessarily\n",
    "      even consistency in the meaning of the \"Lev\" between different\n",
    "      simulations (they are not always directly comparable).  Again,\n",
    "      for reproducibility, it is important to specify the resolution\n",
    "      of the data you use for a given analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three pieces of information may be combined into a single string as in\n",

    "   is deprecated, but it will be loaded anyway.\n",

    "   simulation, if there is only one.  Because no superseding\n",
